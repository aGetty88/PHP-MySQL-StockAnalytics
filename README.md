It will then output specific analytic data based on the stock code given. Ex: IBM
The user can then set specific date range to further filter the data.
The user has multiple options to view stock prices, such as open, close prices.
Once the user has inputed what they want, the program will spit out formated data along with dates for pricing,
    it will also show the mean, median, start, and end prices given all data within the specific date ranges.
    
    
    **** Please note this program will not run on its own and is missing data.
             Line 10 in stock_analytics.php is missing an api key. Go to the above URL, or change it to one of you own,
             get a free api key and enter it on that line.
         I used xampp as my hosting server. There is a username a password in database.php I have left those blank.
             For newer users, if you use xampp create a new user and a password, with all privilages, and enter them into database.php lines 3 and 4.
